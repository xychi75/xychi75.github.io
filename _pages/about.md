My name is Xinyuan Chi, although I often go by Robert. I come from [this place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yanbian_Korean_Autonomous_Prefecture) in Jilin Province, China. I am currently a first-year Master of Arts student in Statistics and Data Science at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://washu.edu/). Previously I received my Bachelor of Arts degree in Economics and Mathematics from [New York University Abu Dhabi](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/) under the supervision of [Giovanni Federico](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/academics/divisions/social-science/faculty/giovanni-federico.html), after completing my capstone thesis in Economic History and Development Economics.
